I am a  Software Engineer at a startup in California, USA. Right now I'm trying to solve a problem using Machine Learning. Reading a book or watching a course and applying that to a project. I also love to blog what I learn. Blogging to me is having an easy to understand resource, which I wish, I had, when I started learning that topic.

I have a full playlist on youtube explaining the core & advanced Java. May be in future I will create more content on ML.
